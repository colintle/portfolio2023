        <p>I am a rising Junior at the University of Central Florida, majoring in Computer Science and Statistics. My interest in coding started in high school when I first saw <i>The Social Network</i> directed by David Fincher.</p>
        <p>Jump to present day, I have had the opportunity to intern at several different organizations including <strong>J.P. Morgan</strong>, <strong>the University of Central Florida</strong>, <strong>Lockheed Martin</strong>, and many more.</p>
